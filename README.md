# Ode to an awesome advisor
We are trying to write this together as a group


## Happies

- seeing everybody on campus is fun
- playing minecraft
-  I got to play broomball last weekend and catch up with the guys
-  First night on duty, had a million things happen and barely got any sleep

## Crappies

- Digging out a car from the snow in the parking lot at 10 Fahrenheit is hard
- driving through a blizzard
- I turned in an assignment 15 min late and got a 0 for it
- Made a lot of new friends since I got here
